# [String Calculator](https://codingdojo.org/kata/StringCalculator/)

This classic kata guides you step by step through the implementation of a calculator that receives a `String` as input. It is a good exercise on refactoring and incremental implementation. It is also a good candidate for practising TDD.

## First step
Create a function `add` that takes a `String` and returns a `String`:

`String add(String number)`

* The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma, and returns their sum.
* An empty string will return “0”.
* Example of inputs: "", "1", "1.1,2.2".

## Many numbers
Allow the `add` method to handle an unknow number of arguments.

## Newline as separator
Allow the `add` method to handle newlines as separators:

* "1\n2,3" should return "6".
* "175.2,\n35" is invalid and should return the message "Number expected but '\n' found at position 6."

## Missing number in last position
Don’t allow the input to end in a separator.

* "1,3," is invalid and should return the message Number expected but EOF found.

## Custom separators

Allow the `add` method to handle a different delimiter. To change the delimiter, the beginning of the input will contain a separate line that looks like this:

`//[delimiter]\n[numbers]`

* "//;\n1;2" should return "3"
* "//|\n1|2|3" should return "6"
* "//sep\n2sep3" should return "5"
* "//|\n1|2,3" is invalid and should return the message "'|' expected but ',' found at position 3."

All existing scenarios should work as before.
